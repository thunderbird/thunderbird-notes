  - note: >
        Datetime formatting is not working properly on the Linux 32bit platform. This results in party broken
        calendar views and incorrect event times - for users on this platform it is strictly recommended to
        backup the user profile before updating and **disable Lightning after updating for the remaining lifetime
        of this version** to avoid damages to calendar data.

  - note: >
        Large attachments may not be shown or saved correctly if the message is stored in an IMAP folder which is
        not synchronized for offline use. **Workaround**: Set preference browser.cache.memory.max_entry_size to the 
        value of -1 (unlimited) and create integer preference browser.cache.memory.capacity with the value of 
        200000 (200 MB, 25 MB per message).

  - note: >

        Start in safe mode and disable McAfee Anti-Spam Extension.
