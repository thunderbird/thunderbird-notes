- note: 'Thunderbird 68 distrusts most SSL/TLS certificates issued by the Certificate Authorities
    (CA) with the brand names Symantec, GeoTrust, RapidSSL and Thawte. Consequently, any
    SSL/TLS connections to servers using an affected certificate will fail. Affected servers
    must be updated to use a different certificate. If Thunderbird displays an error message
    which states that an additional policy constraint has failed, you should check if the
    server uses a certificate issued by one of the mentioned brands. Additional information
    on Mozilla''s action is available at [here](https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2018/03/12/distrust-symantec-tls-certificates/).'
