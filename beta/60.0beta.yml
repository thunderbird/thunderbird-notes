  bug: 1100103
- note: 'Further improvements to attachments handling during compose:
    "Attach" button moved to the right to be above the attachment pane.
    Alt+M now allows to show the attachment pane. The attachment pane can also be shown initially when
    composing a new message. Right-click on the header to enable this option.
    It is now also impossible to completely collapse a non-empty attachment pane.
    That protects against attachments accidentally being sent.'

    "Allow Windows Search/Spotlight to search messages" is selected.'
