- note: '**ADD-ON SUPPORT: Restartless add-ons continue to work if their authors have made the necessary
    minor adjustments. Non-restartless legacy add-ons using XUL overlays are only supported if add-on
    authors have adapted them. ** Apart from Lightning/Calendar there are a few that have been
    adapted, like "ThunderHTMLedit", "Compact Header" and "Signature Switch".
    Instaling legacy add-ons now requires a restart. Legacy add-ons can now specify
    an options page again.'

- note: '** DICTIONARY SUPPORT: Only WebExtension dictionaries are supported now.**
    Please download new dictionaries from addons.mozilla.org since
    addons.thunderbird.net still provides "legacy" dictionaries compatible
    with Thunderbird 60 ESR. This may change as soon as Thunderbird 60 ESR
    can also handle WebExtension dictionaries (planned for version 60.5).'
