notes:
- note: An option under "Tools > Options, Advanced, General" now allows to select
    whether date/time display will follow the application locale (adjusted by operating
    system's format settings for that locale) or the locale selected in the operating
    system's regional settings. In other words, an US English Thunderbird can use,
    for example, German formats.
