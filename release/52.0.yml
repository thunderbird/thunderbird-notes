      **IMPORTANT**: The way images are included in a compose window has changed. Images are now included as data URIs
      and not as references to parts of other messages or operating system files. This allows better interoperability
      with office packages such as MS Office or LibreOffice. Images linked from locations on the internet will **no longer**
      be downloaded and attached to the message automatically. This can be changed for each image individually via the 
      Image Properties dialog or globally by setting the preference mail.compose.attach_http_images.
