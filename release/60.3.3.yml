notes:
- note: 'Thunderbird 60 will migrate security databases (key3.db, cert8.db to key4.db, cert9.db).
    Thunderbird 60.3.2 and earlier contained a fault that potentially deleted saved passwords
    and private certificate keys for users using a master password.
    Version 60.3.3 will prevent the loss of data; affected users
    who have already upgraded to version 60.3.2 or earlier can restore the deleted key3.db
    file from backup to complete the migration.'
