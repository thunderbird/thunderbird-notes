    If you have installed Lightning, Thunderbird's Calendar add-on, it will automatically
    be updated to match the new version of Thunderbird.** Refer to this
    [Calendar troubleshooting article](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/calendar-updates-issues-thunderbird)
    in case of problems.

    • Window: Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 or later
    • Mac: Mac OS X 10.9 or later
    • Linux: GTK+ 3.4 or higher**.

  bug: 1100103
- note: 'Many improvements to attachments handling during compose:
    Attachments can now be reordered using a dialog, keyboard shortcuts, or drag and drop.
    The "Attach" button moved to the right to be above the attachment pane.
    The access key of the attachment pane (e.g. Alt+M, may vary depending on localization, Ctrl+M on Mac)
    now also works to show or hide the pane.
    The attachment pane can also be shown initially when
    composing a new message. Right-click on the header to enable this option.
    Hiding a non-empty attachment pane will now show a placeholder paperclip to indicate
    the presence of attachments and avoid sending them accidentally.'

    for example, German formats.
